        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>Aight, so this is a recipe I'm literally copying off of
        internet for this coding assignment. Here's the description of the cake 
        by the og author: <em>"This is a chocolate cake I make in my air fryer, 
        I like to use a ring tin as it makes the cooking time even shorter, 
        perfect for a couple or small family. Top with icing sugar"</em></p>
        <p>Here's the link to the actual recipe: <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/260623/chocolate-cake-in-an-air-fryer/"><em>Actual Recipe</em></a> </p>

        <ol>

            <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and creamy. Add egg and jam; mix until combined. Sift in flour, cocoa powder, and salt; mix thoroughly. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Level the surface of the batter with the back of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Place pan in the air fryer basket. Cook until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out cleanly, about 15 minutes.</li>
