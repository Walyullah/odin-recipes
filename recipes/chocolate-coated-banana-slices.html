        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>
            This is a recipe I kinda stumbled upon with my brother.
            We were eating frozen grapes, and then I had the sudden idea of melting
            some chocolate chips and then coating the grapes.
            Then we tried the same with banana slices!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 ripe bananas</li>
            <li>semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>toothpicks</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>peel bananas, cut into half an inch to one inch slices, freeze overnight</li>
            <li>when you want to eat, take half a cup of chocolate chips
                and toss them in the microwave, watch them so they don't burn.</li> 
            
            <li>once melted, take a toothpick and skewer a banana slices, then roll it in 
                the melted chocolate, wait a few seconds so the coat hardens, then enjoy!
            </li>

        </ol>
